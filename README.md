# HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp

Please bear with me, I am still learning how to use github.
These were uploaded directly from my vs code account.

I hope to make this more presentable but in the meantime, feel 
free to use these for any referencing or guidance.

I aim to upload more tasks as and when I complete them.
Thanks for stopping by :)
